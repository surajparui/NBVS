# Music Player and Marketplace

This project is a music player and marketplace application developed for the KJ Somaiya Hackathon. The aim of this project is to provide a platform for musicians to buy and sell their content in a convenient and user-friendly manner. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

1. Music Player: The application includes a music player that allows users to play, pause, skip, and control the volume of the songs. It provides a seamless and enjoyable listening experience for users.

2. Content Marketplace: Musicians can register and create accounts to showcase and sell their music. They can upload their tracks, set prices, and manage their inventory. Users can browse through the marketplace, listen to song previews, and purchase the tracks they like.

3. User Authentication: The application implements a secure user authentication system. Musicians and users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. This ensures that only authenticated users can access the marketplace and make purchases.

4. Song Management: Musicians can easily upload and manage their songs. They can add metadata such as title, artist, genre, and duration to their tracks. They can also edit or delete their songs as needed.

5. Search and Filters: Users can search for specific songs or browse through different genres using the search and filter functionality. This makes it easier to discover new music based on their preferences.

6. Shopping Cart: Users can add songs to their shopping cart and proceed to the checkout to complete their purchases. The shopping cart allows users to review their selections and make changes before finalizing the transaction.
